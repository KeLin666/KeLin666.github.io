Hi, this is Ke Lin (Chinese: 林柯, PinYin: Lín Kē, Pronounce: Clean). I am a junior student in Department of Physics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).

From Apr 2020 to Sept 2021, I work as the team leader of representative team of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, participated in the China Undergraduate Physics Competition (CUPT, IYPT in China). We got First Prize in the final defense of our experiment result, this is the first time our school had got this prize since attending this competition. [Here](https://github.com/KeLin666/KeLin666.github.io/blob/master/files/2-Circling%20Magnet.pdf) is a brief introduction to our research.

From Sept 2021 to now, I work as a part-time undergraduate researcher in [Prof. Fangwei Ye's Group](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/jsml/yefangwei.html). My research topic are 3-Dimensional Branched Flow and Nonlinear Branched Flow.

From Jan 2023 to now, I am an exchange student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). I select the following class, 8.292[J] Fluid Physics, 8.422 Atomic and Optical Physics II, 8.431[J] Nonlinear Optics.

In Summer 2023, I will visit Harvard and work as a full-time internship researcher in [Prof. Eric Heller's Group](https://www-heller.harvard.edu/). Our potential project are experimental realization of Branched Flow, study of Bragg scattering.

My research interests lie in the following four parts: Branched Flow, Novel state in Factal system, Non-Hermitian Topological Physics in Photonics.

Feel free to contact me if you have any question about my research. Although I am an undergraduate student, I am very happy to discuss the above research with you！

Research Interests
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
